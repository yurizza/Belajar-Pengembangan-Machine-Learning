# Machine Learning Colab Projects

This repository contains Colab projects focusing on various machine learning tasks, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), time series prediction, and image classification.

## 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project: BBC News Categorization

In this NLP project, the goal is to categorize BBC News articles into one of five categories: sports, business, politics, technology, or entertainment. Leverage state-of-the-art NLP techniques to analyze and classify textual data.

## 2. Time Series Prediction Project: Daily Gold Price Prediction

For the time series prediction project, the focus is on forecasting daily gold prices. Utilize advanced time series analysis and machine learning algorithms to develop models that accurately predict future trends in gold prices.

## 3. Image Classification Project: Classification of 6 Animals

The image classification project involves training models to classify images into one of six categories, each representing a different animal. Dive into the field of computer vision and explore techniques to accurately identify and categorize diverse animal images.

Feel free to explore each project folder for detailed documentation, code, and datasets related to these intriguing machine learning tasks.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
